# Stock Analysis Project Summary Report

## Page 1 – Project Context and Dataset Profile

### Engagement Overview
Since the initial request, the project has focused on understanding and communicating insights from the `temp.csv` OHLCV dataset covering Samsung Electronics, Apple, and NVIDIA. The workstream has combined descriptive analytics, portfolio optimization, and documentation updates to provide stakeholders with actionable knowledge about the equities’ recent performance.【F:README.md†L1-L43】

### Dataset Description
The `temp.csv` file stores daily open, high, low, close, and volume figures for each ticker from 16 October 2023 through 10 October 2025. The multi-level header requires special handling—either via pandas’ hierarchical columns or by skipping header rows when using simpler CSV tooling. Missing values are concentrated in Samsung’s late-2025 records, whereas Apple and NVIDIA maintain complete coverage for 499 trading days apiece.【F:README.md†L5-L25】【F:README.md†L34-L36】

### Initial Descriptive Findings
Price trajectories highlight NVIDIA’s outsized appreciation of nearly 298%, contrasted with Samsung’s 46% and Apple’s 39% cumulative gains. Volume patterns surface major liquidity events, including Apple’s September 2024 spike and NVIDIA’s March 2024 surge. These descriptive statistics formed the foundation for downstream portfolio analysis and storytelling within the README and subsequent deliverables.【F:README.md†L12-L31】

## Page 2 – Efficient Frontier Workflow and Outcomes

### Analytical Approach
To evaluate cross-asset trade-offs, the `efficient_frontier.py` module loads close prices, converts them to log returns, and annualises the resulting moments. The implementation solves a mean–variance efficient frontier through closed-form quadratic programming, deriving both the global minimum-variance allocation and the maximum Sharpe portfolio under a zero risk-free rate assumption.【F:efficient_frontier.py†L1-L118】

### Visualization Deliverable
Executing the script produces `efficient_frontier.svg`, a Matplotlib-rendered chart that plots the frontier curve, individual asset risk/return points, and annotated key portfolios. The diagram anchors the README’s efficient frontier section and communicates diversification benefits by showing how blended portfolios dominate standalone positions.【F:efficient_frontier.py†L120-L170】【F:README.md†L39-L46】

### Portfolio Diagnostics
The workflow reports annualised statistics and optimized weights. Samsung, Apple, and NVIDIA exhibit expected returns of 20.5%, 17.7%, and 75.0% with volatilities of 31.3%, 29.1%, and 51.5%, respectively. The global minimum-variance mix leans toward Samsung (44.1%) and Apple (49.7%) for a 22.5% return at 22.3% risk, while the maximum Sharpe solution shifts weight to NVIDIA (57.7%) to unlock a 51.7% return for 33.6% volatility.【F:README.md†L40-L46】

## Page 3 – Insights, Impact, and Future Directions

### Strategic Insights
1. **Diversification advantage** – Combining Samsung and Apple meaningfully dampens risk relative to NVIDIA while preserving attractive expected returns, underscoring the benefits of cross-market exposure.【F:README.md†L43-L46】
2. **Upside–risk balance** – NVIDIA’s high return potential comes with elevated volatility, suggesting it should be position-sized carefully within institutional or retail portfolios depending on risk tolerance.【F:README.md†L39-L46】
3. **Data readiness considerations** – The multi-row header and Samsung’s missing observations necessitate explicit preprocessing, which the current scripts handle; future ingest pipelines should incorporate similar validation steps.【F:README.md†L5-L25】

### Deliverable Inventory
- README narrative covering dataset characteristics, summary statistics, and efficient frontier insights.
- `efficient_frontier.py` script implementing the analytics pipeline end-to-end.
- `efficient_frontier.svg` visualization capturing the optimization results.
- This three-page report consolidating the project history and key learnings.

### Recommendations and Next Steps
- Extend the analysis to incorporate risk-free assets or factor models, enabling Sharpe calculations grounded in contemporary interest rate assumptions.
- Refresh the dataset periodically and automate anomaly detection for missing rows, ensuring decision-makers rely on up-to-date, clean inputs.
- Explore scenario and stress testing to complement mean–variance outputs with tail-risk perspectives relevant to investment committees.
